### Jun 25, 2025

### Changed

- `toHex()` now returns color strings in Flutter's preferred format using `'0xff$hex'`.

  before prefixing.
- Ensures lowercase `0xff` prefix, matching how Flutter represents colors in source code.

### Changed

- Refactored ColorHexExtension.toHex({bool includeAlpha}) to delegate hex formatting to ColorTools.colorCode(Color) from

  Color.value.
